## Task 4: Display Name After Login

### When is the display name loaded?

The display name is loaded immediately after a successful login or signup, during the `OnEnable()` method of the `GameManager`. Specifically:

* After `FirebaseAuth.SignInWithEmailAndPasswordAsync()` succeeds (login)
* Or after `DatabaseManager.SetDisplayName()` completes (signup)

Once loaded, the app reads `players/<uid>/displayName` from the Realtime Database and updates the UI.

### Firebase Path and Required Information

* **Path:** `players/<uid>/displayName`
* **Required:** The user’s `uid` (from `FirebaseAuth.DefaultInstance.CurrentUser.UserId`)

### If the User is Not Logged In

* The welcome text defaults to `"Welcome, Guest"`
* The game still functions (clicking works), but scores are **not saved** to Firebase
* No database read/write operations are performed (safe fallback)

## Task 6: Leaderboard Design

### Retrieving the Top 3 High Scores from Firebase

To get the top 3 players by score, query the `players` node like this:

```javascript
ref.child("players")
   .orderByChild("score")
   .limitToLast(3)
   .once("value", callback);
```

This will return the three highest-scoring players, which you can then display in the leaderboard UI.
