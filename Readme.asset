About This Game

Welcome to my Unity first-person 3D level! You’ll explore indoor and outdoor areas, collect shiny coins, avoid tricky hazards, and hop on moving platforms. If you touch a hazard, no worries — you’ll respawn safely at the yellow block to try again.



How to Play

What You Need
- A Windows PC, Mac, or Linux computer (Windows recommended)
- Unity 2023 or newer (tested on 2023.1)
- Keyboard and mouse

Controls

| Move forward     | W or Up Arrow          |
| Move backward    | S or Down Arrow        |

What’s in the Game

- Coins: Sparkly coins spin around. Grab as many as you can to boost your score, which you can see on the screen.

- Hazards: Watch out for red blocks that move or spin! Touch them, and you’ll be sent back to the yellow respawn spot.

- Moving Platforms: Some blocks slide left and right — time your jumps carefully or you might fall.

- Score Display: Your coin count is always visible in the UI, so you know how you’re doing.



## Known Issues

- Moving platforms have fixed speed and don’t react to you.
- Sometimes the respawn might feel a little jittery due to how teleporting works.
- No sound effects yet for picking up coins or hitting hazards.
- The game doesn’t save your progress or scores.
- The “puzzle” is pretty straightforward — just avoid hazards and collect coins.



Credits

- All models are simple Unity cubes and materials — nothing fancy or external.
- Scripts and coding by me, GrobenTham & ChatGPT.
- UI uses Unity’s TextMeshPro for crisp on-screen text.



Tips & Tricks

- Collect as many coins as you can to rack up your score.
- Stay clear of red hazards — they’ll send you back to start.
- Watch the timing on moving platforms and jump carefully.



What’s Next?

If I add more features, here’s what I’d like to do:

- Add sound effects to make the game more lively.
- Create cool animations for doors or other objects.
- Implement checkpoints so you don’t have to restart from the beginning.
- Add more puzzles and challenges to keep things interesting.
- Maybe add a health or lives system for more gameplay depth.
